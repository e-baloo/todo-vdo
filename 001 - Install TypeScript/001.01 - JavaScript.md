# 1 - Initializing the Project

To get started, create a new folder named ``node_project`` and move into that directory:

```bash
mkdir node_project
cd node_project
```

Next, initialize it as an npm project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

# 2 - Configuring the TypeScript Compiler

Now that your npm project is initialized, you are ready to install and set up TypeScript.

Run the following command from inside your project directory to install the TypeScript:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

TypeScript uses a file called tsconfig.json to configure the compiler options for a project. 
Initilize the file with ``tsc`` 

```
npx tsc --init
```

# 3 - First programe

Create file ``./index.ts``
```ts
const world = 'world';

export function hello(who: string = world): string {
  return `Hello ${who}! `;
}

console.log(hello());
```

Transpil TypeScritp to JavaScript
```bash
npx tsc
``` 

Execut the JavaScript file
```bash
node ./index.js
```

# 4 - Project Organisation

Edit file ``./tsconfig.json`` and add or update the line :
```json
    "outDir": "./dist",

```

Create directory ``./src``
```bash
mkdir ./src
```

Move ``./index.ts`` to ``./src``
```bash
mv ./index.ts ./src
```

And delete first compilation file ``./index.js``
```bash
rm ./index.js
```


# 5 - Re Transplie the code

Execut the command :
```bash
npx tsc
```

Now the file ``index.js`` is in directory ``./dist``

For exectue the Js File
```bash
node ./dist/index.js
```
